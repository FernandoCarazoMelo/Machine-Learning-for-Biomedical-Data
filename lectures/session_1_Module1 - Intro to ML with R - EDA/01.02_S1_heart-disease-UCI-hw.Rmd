# Introduction

According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute:

> Heart disease is a catch-all phrase for a variety of conditions that affect the heart’s structure and function. Coronary heart disease is a type of heart disease that develops when the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. __It is the leading cause of death in the United States__.

(Emphasis by me. Source: https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/espanol/enfermedad-coronaria)

Also, according to the World Health Organization, cardiovascular diseases are the __leading cause of death globally__ (source:  https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cardiovascular-diseases-(cvds)). 

In this notebook we try to learn enough information of this topic to understand the [Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) dataset and build simple models to predict whether a patient has a disease or not based on features like the heart rate during exercise or the cholesterol levels in the blood.



# Context

## Blood and heart

Blood is very important to ensure the proper functioning of the body. Its functions cover the transport of oxygen and nutrients to the cells of the body as well as the removal of the cellular waste products.

Blood is transported to the rest of the body because it is pumped by the heart. This organ receives oxygen-poor blood and sends it to the lungs to oxygenate it. And sends the oxygen-rich blood that comes from the lugns to the rest of the body.

Blue arrows represent oxygen-poor blood received from the rest of the body and sent to the lungs. Red arrows represent oxygen-rich blood coming from the lungs that is sent to the rest of the body.

An inadequate supply of the blood can yield the cells to not get enough energy to function properly, causing the death of the cells in the worst case.


## Coronary heart disease

The heart also needs oxygen and nutrients to function properly, these come through arteries known as coronary arteries. When we talk about a coronary disease, we often mean a difficulty of the blood flow in these arteries due to the accumulation of substances on their walls.

In the worst case, the impact of leaving the cells of the heart without nutrients and oxygen is a heart attack, in other words, the death of part of the heart cells. This, in turn, would have an impact on the rest of the body because the pumping of the heart would be affected.


## Glossary of terms

- **Atherosclerosis:** accumulation of substances on the walls of arteries which can hinder the blood flow. Moreover, the rupture of this plaque of substances can cause the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) that, in turn, can block even more the affected area or go to other parts of the body and block those parts (embolism). (Sources: [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/cholesterol/about-cholesterol/atherosclerosis), [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/arteriosclerosis-atherosclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350569))

- **Ischemia:** blood flow reduction to a tissue. This implies a reduction of the supply of oxygen and nutrients, so cells won't get enough energy to function properly. (Sources: [American Heart Association](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/silent-ischemia-and-ischemic-heart-disease), [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocardial-ischemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20375417), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ischemia))

- **Angina:** chest pain due to a blood flow reduction in the coronary arteries. (Sources: [United Kingdom National Health Service](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/angina/), [(Spanish) Video sobre angina de Alberto Sanagustín](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UhItS50mRI))

- **Stable angina:** angina caused by situations that requires oxygen (for example, exercise or stress) and it goes away on rest.

- **Unstable angina:** angina that can happen even on rest.

- **Typican & atypical angina:** typical angina usually means a chest disconfort. However, looks like some people can experience other symptoms like nausea or shortness of breath. In these cases people talk about atypical angina. (Sources: [Harrington Hospital](https://www.harringtonhospital.org/typical-and-atypical-angina-what-to-look-for/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angina#Diagnosis)).

- **Thrombus:** blood mass in solid state that hinders the blood flow in a blood vessel. (Source: [MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001124.htm))

- **Embolus:** thrombus that detatches and goes to other parts of the body. (Source: [MedlinePlus](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001124.htm))

- **Acute myocardial infarction:** also known as _heart attack_, is the death of part of the heart tissue due to an ischemia. In other words, it is the death of part of the cells due to the lack of oxygen. (Sources: [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/acute-myocardial-infarction#causes), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infarction))

- **Electrocardiogram:** graph record of the electric signals that causes heart beats. Each part of the record of a normal heart beat has a name, the most interesting ones for this project are the T wave and the ST segment because they can give some information about the presence of issues like an ischemia or infarction. (Sources: [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983), [Wikipedia](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocardiograma), [(Spanish) Video sobre electrocardiograma de Alberto Sanagustín](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A67NDj3_RrU), [(Spanish) Serie de videos sobre el electrocardiograma normal de Alberto Sangaustín](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLe281LBBRU&list=PL3BE5DA0A5DF3BF75))

- **Nuclear stress test:** a radioactive dye is injected into the patient to see the blood flow on rest and doing exercise. Moreover, during this test the activity of the heart is also measured with an electrocardiogram. (Sources: [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/nuclear-stress-test/about/pac-20385231), [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/thallium-stress-test))

- **Asymptomatic disease:** a disease that a patient has but they experience very few or no symptoms. (Sources: [(Spanish) definicion.de](https://definicion.de/asintomatico/), [MayoClinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/es-es/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/expert-answers/silent-heart-attack/faq-20057777), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic))

- **Left ventricular hypertrophy:** thickening of the walls of the main heart chamber that pumps the blood to the rest of the body. This can cause the muscle to loose elasticity which, in turns, causes the heart to not work properly. (Sources: [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/left-ventricular-hypertrophy/symptoms-causes/syc-20374314))


# Dataset

This dataset is hosted on Kaggle ([Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci)), and it was from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). There are records of about 300 patients from Cleveland and the features are described in a following section.

According to the information provided by Kaggle, the available variables are:

Context

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. 

*The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient.*

Content

Attribute Information:

1. age
2. sex
3. chest pain type (4 values)
4. resting blood pressure
5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl

*Hereon, variables are related to a nuclear stress test. That is, a stress test where a radioactive dye is also injected to the patient to see the blood flow:*

7. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
8. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang: exercise induced angina
10.oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
12. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

The names and social security numbers of the patients were recently removed from the database, replaced with dummy values. One file has been "processed", that one containing the Cleveland database. All four unprocessed files also exist in this directory.

# Exploratory data analysis

Before training a predictive model, or even before performing any calculation with a new data set, it is important to carry out a descriptive exploration of them. This process allows a better understanding of what information each variable contains, as well as detecting possible errors. Some common examples are:

- That a column has been stored with the wrong type: a numeric variable is being recognized as text or vice versa.

- That a variable contains values that do not make sense: for example, to indicate that the price of a home is not available, enter the value 0 or a blank space.

- That a word has been entered in a numeric type variable instead of a number.

Furthermore, this initial analysis can give clues as to which variables are suitable as predictors in a model (more on this in the following sections).

The skimr, DataExplorer and GGally packages make this task a lot easier thanks to their pre-configured functions.

## Variable type

Before training a predictive model, or even before performing any calculation with a new data set, it is very important to carry out a descriptive exploration of them. This process allows us to better understand what information each variable contains, as well as detect possible errors. Some common examples are:

- That a column has been stored with the wrong type: a numeric variable is being recognized as text.

- That a variable contains values that do not make sense: e.g, that the height of a person is not available, enter the value zero or a blank space. There is no one whose height is zero.

- That a word has been entered in a numeric type variable instead of a number.

- Furthermore, it can give clues as to which variables are not suitable as predictors in a model (more on this in the following sections).

</p>





### thal

Results of the blood flow observed via the radioactive dye.

- Value 0: NULL (dropped from the dataset previously)
- Value 1: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart)
- Value 2: normal blood flow
- Value 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)



### ca


This feature refers to the number of narrow blood vessels seen.


# Models

For this part I chose to build four models. Three simple ones: logistic regression, naïve bayes and decision trees. And one a bit more complex: random forest.

Null values where already dropped in a previous cell. Also, categorical variables have already been converted to R factors. Apart from this no more explicit preprocessing was done in this notebook to keep it simple and easy to follow.

To compare the models we first divide the dataset in a training set with 70% of instances and a test set with the rest of the instances. And this taking into account that the distribution of the target has to be the same in both sets.

The test set mimics data in the real world, it will only be used at the end of the project to get a more robust measure of the models on unseen data.

The training set will be used to evaluate the models via 10 fold cross-validation. For simplicity, we'll leave the hypeparameter selection of the models by default, this means that some random combinations will be chosen and the models will be trained via cross-validation for each combination, keeping the hiperparameter combination that gave the best result.
